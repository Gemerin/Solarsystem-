getPlanets() may expose internal representation by returning Star.planets 
May expose internal representation by returning reference to mutable object 
Returning a reference to a mutable object value stored in one of the 
  object's fields exposes the internal representation of the object. If 
  instances are accessed by untrusted code, and unchecked changes to the 
  mutable object would compromise security or other important properties, 
  you will need to do something different. Returning a new copy of the 
  object is better approach in many situations.
